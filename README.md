### What is this game?
The Adventures of Horse the Horse is a pet simulator game where you take care of your horse.

My main goal for this project is to make a game that is bad on purpose. Everything will be incredibly low effort except for the gameplay.

### How to play

There is an in-game tutorial, but some of the icons may be confusing to some people, so here are their descriptions:
